My Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project

# Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data

My Project is about gathering ATP (Mens) and WTA (Womens) Tennis data including a player list, matches played, and rankings to show various types of information. 

The end solution will provide a schema which allows users to extract data on players, matches, and tournaments including matches played in 2020, match performances in a given time period, and how a player's ranking has changed over time. 

I have gathered this data from https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#sports using both the ATP and WTA links. I will combine the datasets together. These datasets which involve both the ATP and WTA include:

- A players dataset which gathers player information 
- A rankings dataset which gathers a player's ranking over time (2020 only but room for further scope to increase dataload)
- A matches dataset which gathers match data including, who won the match, the score, player stats and which tournament the match was played in. (2020 only but room for further scope to increase dataload)


# Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
